This repository contains my work for Applied Data Analysis (QAC 201) at Wesleyan University, Spring of 2019, and has been completed.

It is a project based course, and my project is to examine data from the Outlook on Life Surveys (OOL) to investigate the association between American political interest and one's belief of whether "church & politics" should be seperate (See OOL codebook, documentation, etc). The project further investigates how secondary factors such as religious affiliation may influence the association.

The ‘QAC Project’ R script contains all of my up to date work on the project in an organized manner: incorporating data management, statistical analysis, and data visualization with ggplot2. The course culminated in a presentation forum. I have not written any finalized works to be published or used for my major, however I plan to do so in the future.

The poster I used for my presentation can be found here, and it is written so as to be clear to those who do not know anything about coding or data analysis.
