This repository contains my work for Applied Data Analysis (QAC 201) at Wesleyan University, Spring of 2019, and is in the final stages of completion.

It is a project based course, and my project is to examine data from the Outlook on Life Surveys (OOL) to investigate the association between American political interest and one's belief of whether "church & politics" should be seperate (See OOL codebook, documentation, etc.). The project further investigates how secondary factors such as religious affiliation may influence the association.

For the most up to date plots, and those which I plan to use in my final presentation, see the "Final Plots" folder. 

The ‘QAC Project’ R script contains all of my up to date work on the project in an organized manner: incorporating data management, statistical analysis, and data visualization with ggplot2. From this I will be writing a research paper, and the course culminates in a presentation forum.
