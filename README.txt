This repository contains my work for Applied Data Analysis (QAC 201) at Wesleyan University.

It is a project based course, and my project is to examine data from the Outlook on Life Surveys to investigate the association between American political interest and faith in Congress.  

The ‘QAC Project’ R script contains all of my up to date work on the project in an organized manner: incorporating data management, statistical analysis, and data visualization with ggplot2. From this I will be writing a research paper, and the course culminates in a presentation forum.
